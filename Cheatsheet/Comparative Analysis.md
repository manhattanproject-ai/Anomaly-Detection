# Comparative Analysis of Different Anomaly Detection Technique

Here is a comparison of different anomaly detection techniques, detailing their approach, strengths, and weaknesses.

|Technique Category|	Core Mechanism	|Strengths (Pros)	|Weaknesses (Cons)|
|--------|---|---|---|
|1. Statistical Methods üìä|	Assumes a known distribution (e.g., Gaussian) for normal data. Anomalies are points with low probability of belonging to that distribution (e.g., beyond 3œÉ).|	Simple, fast, and highly interpretable. Effective for univariate data with clear distributions.	|Poor performance on high-dimensional data. Requires assumptions about the data's distribution. Struggles with contextual and collective anomalies.|
|2. Density-Based Methods üß≠|	Defines anomalies as points that lie in sparse regions of the data space (low local density) compared to their neighbors (e.g., LOF).|	Highly effective at finding outliers in complex, non-linear data distributions. Doesn't require prior training on labeled data.|	Sensitive to the choice of density/distance parameters (e.g., k). Computationally expensive, especially for very large datasets due to distance calculations.|
|3. Cluster-Based Methods üåê|	Identifies anomalies as data points that do not belong to any significant cluster or are far from any cluster centroid (e.g., k-Means, DBSCAN).|	Intuitive and works well when normal data forms clear, dense groups. DBSCAN can find irregularly shaped clusters.|	Performance is highly dependent on the quality of the clustering. Less effective if anomalies form small clusters themselves. Sensitive to the number of clusters (k).|
|4. Classification /Boundary-Based Methods üõ°Ô∏è|	Learns a tight boundary around the normal data (one-class classification). Anything falling outside this boundary is flagged as an anomaly (e.g., One-Class SVM).|	Highly effective when training data contains only normal instances. Robust to noise if the boundary is well-defined.|	Computationally intensive for training on massive datasets. The boundary is heavily influenced by the kernel choice and parameters. Difficult to update incrementally.|
|5. Tree-Based Methods (Isolation Forest) üå≤|	Explicitly isolates outliers instead of profiling normal points. Since anomalies are few and structurally different, they are separated closer to the root of a decision tree with fewer splits.|	Highly efficient and scalable for high-volume, high-dimensional data. Doesn't require distance calculation, making it fast.|	Less effective if the dataset contains many irrelevant features ("feature pollution"). Does not naturally handle time-series or sequence data without explicit feature engineering.|
