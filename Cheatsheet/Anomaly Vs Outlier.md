# Anomaly Vs Outlier

The terms anomaly and outlier are often used interchangeably in the context of data analysis and machine learning, as both refer to data points that deviate from the norm. However, in technical and academic literature, a subtle distinction is often made, especially within the field of Anomaly Detection.

|Feature|	Anomaly (Technical/Contextual Term)|	Outlier (Statistical/General Term)|
|--------|---|---|
|Primary Focus|	Deviation from expected behavior or pattern.|	Extreme deviation from the statistical mean or distribution.|
|Nature of Deviation|	Can be a single extreme value (point anomaly) or a deviation only relevant in a specific context (time, location) or sequence (collective anomaly).|	Primarily refers to Point Anomaliesâ€”individual data points far outside the bulk of the data.|
|Contextual Dependence|	High. An anomaly's significance often depends on factors like time, location, or surrounding data points.|	Low. Defined purely by its magnitude relative to the rest of the dataset's distribution.|
|Use Case|	Widely used in operational systems like cybersecurity (intrusion detection) and system monitoring (predictive maintenance) to flag events.|	Widely used in statistical analysis and data cleaning (e.g., removing extreme values before calculating the mean).|

## Summary

* Outlier is a broader, statistical term: An outlier is any data point that lies an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample. All single, extreme deviations are outliers.
* Anomaly is an event-driven term: An anomaly is often used in the context of identifying a malicious or critical event that deviates from a learned "normal" profile. The term is more inclusive, covering deviations that are not just extreme values, but also:
    * Contextual Anomalies: A normal value occurring at an abnormal time (e.g., high energy usage at 3 AM).
    * Collective Anomalies: A sequence of normal-looking events that are unusual when grouped (e.g., three logins from three different countries in five minutes).

In essence, all point anomalies are outliers, but not all outliers are necessarily critical anomalies that an operational system needs to flag, and not all types of anomalies (like contextual or collective) would be flagged by simple statistical outlier methods.
